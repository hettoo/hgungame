# hGunGame

Series of Warsow gametype scripts.

Use `make dev` to create and copy the pk3 file and run the server (it assumes
a couple of things, check the makefile).

NOTE: the current version is a work in progress. Use it for testing only.

After version 0.1 development will probably move to a development branch so that
master remains for stable releases.
